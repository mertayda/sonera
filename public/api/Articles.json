    "p": "Initial installation costs for Urathene systems may be slightly higher than epoxy, but longer maintenance intervals significantly reduce total ownership cost. In high-traffic areas, its mechanical wear resistance delays resurfacing needs and reduces downtime. Proper surface preparation and correct mixing ratios can extend system lifespan from 2–3 years to over 5 years."

    "p": "When planning the maintenance cycle, cleaning frequency, chemical exposure duration, and UV impact should be considered. Urathene’s low porosity means less dirt and detergent residue build-up, reducing labor costs for cleaning. Annual inspections and small touch-ups can save 25–40% compared to full resurfacing."
